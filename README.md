# SHCPOC
SHCPOC = Slime Hunter Combat POC

Test project, dev in C++ with WSL2 using SDL2.
Stopped working on this project because compiling c++ with WSL2 for windows is "ok" but testing isn't.

## [EDIT]
The problem was WSL2 being headless and launching a test build on windows via vscode (WSL2) wasn't vaible.
Should be viable under windows 11, since WSL2 in W11 can have GUI display. ([See Here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/gui-apps))
